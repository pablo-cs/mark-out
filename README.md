## Description

Mark Out is an upcoming web application which serves as a journal for professional wrestling fans. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for searching for matches, promotions, events, and wrestlers in order to easily save the matches they've watched or want to watch in the future.

Some features of this app will include:
- User profiles with profile pics, user names, and other standard social media features
- A playlist feature to save various matches in multiple lists on a profile
- A review feature for users to characterize matches based on qualities like intensity, pacing, crowd reaction, acrobatics, etc
- A search feature to find matches based on numerous criteria (length, duration, company, wrestlers, etc)

This app is being built with Django and SQLite for for the backend service, and will use React for the front end of the application.

This app will pull from **The Internet Wrestling Database** (http://www.profightdb.com/) to obtain up to date match information.
